This is the first assignment given in PHP for the web developer class of 2017 at YRGO, Sweden.

## Languages

This project is built with HTML, CSS, PHP and lots of meow.

## Get Started

This is what you need to open this project:

### Installing

1. Click on the green "Clone or download" button on the upper right, and clone or download the repository.
